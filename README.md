# CIFAR-10-Image-Classifcation-Using-CNN-and-Deployment-with-Flask
Developed a machine learning project to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN). 
Developed a Flask web application to deploy the trained model, allowing users to upload and classify images in realtime.
